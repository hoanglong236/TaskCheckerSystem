The maximum time difference between tasks is 1s.

Convention:
	Real-time axis: Ot (the unit is second)
	The split points on the Ot axis are 1 second apart and all belong to the sets of natural numbers N

	Timer time axis: Ot' (the unit is second)
	The split points on the Ot' axis are 1 second apart and all belong to the sets of natural numbers N

On the Ot axis,
	a' is the time (second) when the Timer is initialized (a' > 0, a' belongs to R),
	a is the nearest separating point (a < a', a belongs to N)
=> 0 <= x = a' - a < 1

On the Ot' axis,
	b' is the time (second) when the Task is initialized (b' > 0, b' belongs to R),
	b is the nearest separating point (b < b', b belongs to N)
=> 0 <= y = b' - b < 1

On the Ot' axis, at the nth cycle:
	The corresponding position of the Task: T' = n + y (each cycle is 1s)

Reference the Task position from the Ot' axis to the Ot axis:
	Position of Task on the Ot axis: T = a' + T'
							           = a + x + n + y
							           = (a + n) + (x + y)

						            => a + n <= T < a + n + 2
This means that the two tasks have real time difference if and only if
	T1 < a + n + 1 and a + n + 1 <= T2
<=> 0 <= x + y1 < 1 and 1 <= x + y2 < 2

In case T is an integer, then T will have the set of values: {a + n, a + n + 1}
Therefore, the maximum time difference between 2 tasks is 1s.
